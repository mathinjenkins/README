# What is Math in Jenkins?

Math in Jenkins is a prototype for a multi-module `C++` project that needs to adopt Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines. The project is an implementation of [Stirling formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation) for calculating factorials. However, the implementation has one constraint: **no use of math libraries**. Therefore, the different components of the formula have to be implemented from scratch; mostly using approximation formulas and trying to improve the precision over the lifetime of the modules.
